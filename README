Overview
========

It is difficult to decide which system is right for your application,
partially because the features differ between systems, and partially
because there is not an easy way to compare the performance of one
system versus another.

The goal of the YCSB project is to develop a framework and common set
of workloads for evaluating the performance of different "key-value"
and "cloud" serving stores. The project comprises two things:

* The YCSB Client, an extensible workload generator

* The Core workloads, a set of workload scenarios to be executed by
  the generator

Although the core workloads provide a well rounded picture of a
system's performance, the Client is extensible so that you can define
new and different workloads to examine system aspects, or application
scenarios, not adequately covered by the core workload. Similarly, the
Client is extensible to support benchmarking different
databases. Although we include sample code for benchmarking HBase and
Cassandra, it is straightforward to write a new interface layer to
benchmark your favorite database.

A common use of the tool is to benchmark multiple systems and compare
them. For example, you can install multiple systems on the same
hardward configuration, and run the same workloads against each
system. Then you can plot the performance of each system (for example,
as latency versus throughput curves) to see when one system does
better than another.

Detailed information about using the benchmark is available in the
doc/index.html file.
